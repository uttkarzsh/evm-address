# Ethereum Address Derivation (Solidity + Foundry)

A simple learning project that demonstrates how an Ethereum address is derived from a private key directly in Solidity, using the **secp256k1** curve.

It performs:
1. Public key generation from a private key (`k * G` on secp256k1)
2. Hashing the public key with `keccak256`
3. Taking the last 20 bytes to form the Ethereum address
